If we define ideology to require some relation to power, then pure religion as outlined above (narrativisation of being, deification of the world, divinization of the sublime) is not ideology, at least initially.  Imagine a peasant watching the sun set after a day in the fields.  Initially he is overwhelmed by the sublime, there is no narrative, just pure being.  Only immediately after the fact does he think that such beauty could only be a gift from God.  This initial narrative is neutral and refers only to some sublime which in this case, gets interpreted/formalized as gratitude.  Such a narrative understands being insofar that for the subject it refers to some experience of pure being (in other words, the subject attempts to narrativise an "experience" of the loss of subjectivity).  It only comes to relate to power when the subject is called upon.  When the peasant is called upon to fight in a war, an overarching narrative consummates the former narrative such that the peasant thinks, "I must fight for God's beautiful Earth and sky for which I'm so grateful for".  This is religious ideology (in later ideologies we will see that there is no initial neutrality which is subsumed, but ideology is totalizing.  There is no room to narrativise being).  Religious ideology is zeroth order ideology, it is a form of ideology that has existed since the beginning of civilization.
