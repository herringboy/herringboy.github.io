She's there sprawled across the chair like a man.  Comfortable, her hair in two little knots, with a soft beige semi-velvet sweater-shirt.  Her soft breasts leaving hemispherical impressions---upturned slightly with distinct nipples resting just above the equator.  Perfectly young, the platonic form of a healthy breast.  Could rest perfectly in a palm, not too large.  
Her eyes are piercing hazel marmalade.  She sees through me.  She sees through the clown, the shroud of "irony" (whatever the fuck that means) and sees something pathetic.  And I see through her.  And she doesnt think about me for a moment.  Not ever.  She's petrifying.  For at least the first month my heart beat nearly winded me as I walked into the room.  I talked to her a few times leaving our meetings.  I even really connected with her the first time we talked (although I cant say the reverse is true).  Similar experiences with escapism (i.e., adolescent drug use and delinquency) and hey! we're both Taurus!  I even got her snapchat the third time we talked, but that's it.  
And her bralessness taunts me.  Sitting just a few feet from me in a shitty break-room lounge chair.  So close I could kick her (playfully), but I will never.  The window is closed.  So I sit there talking about whatever the fuck, the others are laughing, I even get her to smile and respond---for a moment the mask holds.  But that form-fitting sweater-thing taunts me.
